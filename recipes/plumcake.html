<p>This pretty plum cake is made with a buttery sponge cake recipe, topped with sliced plums, cinnamon, and sugar before being baked to perfection for a delicious way of using fresh plums when in season. Serve with whipped cream.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    <li>12 medium ripe plums, halved and pitted</li>
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons cinnamon sugar, or to taste</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch springform pan.</li>

    <li>Combine sugar and butter in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, and beat well after each addition. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl and sift on top of the butter mixture; mix to combine. Transfer batter into the prepared springform pan and smooth out.</li>
        
    <li>Set plums inside batter, cut-side up, and sprinkle evenly with cinnamon-sugar.</li>
        
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven on the lowest rack until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Serve warm or cool to room temperature.</li>
